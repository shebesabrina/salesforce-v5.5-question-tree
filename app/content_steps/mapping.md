If there was anyting selected in the 'Map Invoca Call Data to Leads & Contacts' section (based on your PDF or screenshot) make sure the same values are selected as the previous admin settings.

It's encouraged to not map too many values in this section and only map data that you will need displayed to call agents and Salesforce reports. If there are data attributes that are blank or no longer being used we encourage you to not map these attributes in the Invoca Admin settings. Salesforce reports have the option to join objects so you can retrieve data Invoca Call Log data by joining your objects when buliding Salesforce reports.

**Please note, this package does not map data if the field data type is a picklist. This package can only map data if the Salesforce field is a text data type.**
