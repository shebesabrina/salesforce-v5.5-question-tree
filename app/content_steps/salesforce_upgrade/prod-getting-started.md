## Congratulations! 
Now that you have everything working in your sandbox environment, we will be implementing the same setup in your Production instance.

1. **Before installing v5.5**, take a screenshot of your current "Invoca Admin" page in your Salesforce Sandbox instance.
2. Install the newest version of the package which can be located from [Invocaâ€™s AppExchange listing](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t2I000000MhnHQAS).
3. In Salesforce, configure the Invoca Admin Settings
4. In Invoca, authenticate and configure the connect app setting
5. Conduct end-to-end testing

* Before you get started you will want to make sure your **Salesforce Admin** has access to the "Authenticating User" that originally installed the integrations.
