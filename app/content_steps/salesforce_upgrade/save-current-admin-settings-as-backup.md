### Step 1 - Capture your current Salesforce Settings as a backup

Before installing the latest version, please complete the following: 

- Print (as PDF) or take a screenshot of your current "Invoca Admin" settings page in your Salesforce production Instance. 
    - When you upgrade to the latest version, the Invoca Admin settings will need to be reconfigured. Having a screenshot for reference will help you reconfigure the settings quickly. 
    
**Please note**, if you have anything selected in the 'Map Invoca Call Data to Leads & Contacts' section make sure you keep note of all the index names because you will need to re-map this data in the new version admin settings.
