## Welcome! 
This is a tutorial to assist your Salesforce Admin to implement the latest version of the Invoca Salesforce Sales Cloud Integration! To provide an overview, we will be undertaking six primary steps to enhance the Invoca/Salesforce integration.

1. **Before installing v5.5**, take a screenshot of your current "Invoca Admin" page in your Salesforce Production instance.
2. Install the newest version of the package which can be located from [Invocaâ€™s AppExchange listing](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t2I000000MhnHQAS).
3. In Salesforce, configure the Invoca Admin Settings
4. In Invoca, authenticate and configure the connect app setting
5. Conduct end-to-end testing
6. In Salesforce, install package in Production and complete steps 1-5 again

* Before you get started you will want to make sure your **Salesforce Admin** has access to the "Authenticating User" that originally installed the integrations.
