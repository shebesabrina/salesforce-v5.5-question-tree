### Step 3 - Configure Invoca Admin Settings in Salesforce: Custom Matching

Check to see if the 'custom matching' checkbox is enabled in your Production instance, you might have choosen this if you have a unique identifier that is available in the Salesforce record and also from the website (e.g. a customer ID that is stored in a cookie on the website and also in a field on the Contact record).

**Please note, if you enabled custom field matching and "Caller ID" is selected in your Production instance, this set up is no longer neccessary for the latest version. You can skip this step and keep the 'Custom Matching' unchecked.**
