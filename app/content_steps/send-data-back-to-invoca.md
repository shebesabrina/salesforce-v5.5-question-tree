Depending on what was selected in the 'Optional: Send Data from Salesforce to Invoca' section make sure the same selection is checked as the previous admin settings. 

It's important to keep the same settings as your Produciton settings and test to make sure everything is working as expected. If you make changes please test your current setup and make minior adjustments once all tests are passing.

Once all settings are configured, click 'Save'.
