When you upgrade to version 5.5 from prior versions, the Invoca Admin settings will need to be reconfigured. Having a screenshot to reference will help you reconfigure the settings quickly. Please note, if you have anything selected in the 'Map Invoca Call Data to Leads & Contacts' section make sure you keep note of all the index names because you will need to re-map this data in the new version admin settings"

Please note that once you upgrade to version 5.5, it is not possible to revert back to a prior version! If you have any issues installing the package, please search for Deployment in your Salesforce Setup, then click Deployment Status and resolve any errors.
